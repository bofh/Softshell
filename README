I'm terrible at writing these readme files, so bear with me.

Much more information is available on my blog at: alternet.us.com

This code leverages the Osmocom RTL-SDR code heavily.
Their website is here: http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr

As their code is GPL v. 2, so is this code.  A copy of the GPL is available
in the COPYING file.

At the current time, only the E4000 tuner is supported, as it's the only one I have.
I accept donations if you want ports of other tuners supported.
